Weather and forecasts for humans.
Information you can act on.

Most weather apps throw a lot of information at you
but that doesn't answer the question of "What does it feel like outside?".
Tropos answers this by relating the current conditions
to conditions at the same time yesterday.

Setup
-----

Run `bin/setup`

This will:

- Install `fastlane`, `swiftlint` and `xcpretty`
- Install the carthage dependencies
- Create `Secrets.h`. `TRForecastAPIKey` is the only one required for the
  application to run. You can get a key from https://developer.forecast.io. You
  should include all keys for production builds.

Testing
-------

Run `bin/test`

This will run the tests from the command line, and pipe the result through
[XCPretty][].
